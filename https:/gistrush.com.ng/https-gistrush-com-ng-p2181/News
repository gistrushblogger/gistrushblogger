All eight individuals on board a private plane died when it crashed into an unoccupied office building in Milan, northern Italy.

After taking off from Milan's Linate airport, the plane, which was heading for the island of Sardinia, came down.

Dan Petrescu, a 68-year-old Romanian businessman, was the pilot. According to Italian media, he died beside his wife and son.

The collision set fire to the office building and numerous parked cars. No one was hurt on the ground.


An inspection into the accident's cause has begun.
The single-engine Pilatus PC-12, according to some onlookers, was on fire when it crashed.

"I heard the sound of a jet shutting down its engine above me," city resident Giuseppe told the Reuters news agency.

"Then I heard a very massive sound, and our house's windows began to shake," he continued. "I looked out the window and saw a huge plume of smoke rising."

Petrescu, a real estate developer, was one of Romania's wealthiest individuals. A toddler is said to be among those dead, in addition to him, his wife, and their 30-year-old son.
